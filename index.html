JavaScript - DAY2


What is Hoisting?
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions,
 variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

Note: Only declarations are hoisted not initialization.


What are the types of variables in JS?
In JavaScript, there are three different variable types: var , let , and const .
 Each of these variables have several rules around how they should be used,
  and have different characteristics.

Var: 
       Var is a global scope variable.
       Var can reassigned.
       Var can be redeclared.
       Var can be modified later.

       let:
       let is a block scope.
       let cannot be reassigned.
       let cannot be redeclared.
       let can be modified later.
       
       const: 
       const is a block scope.
       const cannot be reassigned.
       canst cannot be redeclared.
       const cannot be modified later.



What are closures?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
 surrounding state (the lexical environment).
 In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
  In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created,
   at function creation time.



What is a temporal dead zone?
A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until
the moment the computer completely initializes it with a
 value. A block is a pair of braces ( {...} ) used to group multiple statements.
  Initialization occurs when you assign an initial value to a variable.
